# Visual backend
This is an experiment to see how we can build the entire application using AI. 

A non-techie would want to build their own UI, but they would not know how to connect that UI with the backend to make everything work. But with AI, we can now generate the backend logic for them, given their UI.

For example, if the builder wants a table on the screen. He/she knows what data to show on the table. So the easiest way is to specify the data to show on the table, and then the AI will generate the backend that fetches the data from the database and then connects that with the table on the UI.
